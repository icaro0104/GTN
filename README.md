## A c++ simple terminal math game.

 This is my first c++ aplication, itÂ´s very simple but i had a lot of fun doing it.

 It took me arround 3-4 hours to get all  the cpp concepts i needed to build this game, although very fun, honestly, it isn't the most begginer-friendly language.
 
 The game works like this: 
            
            01. you are asked to select which mode and difculty you want ( {1 for easy, 2 for hard} style ).
            02. we get your input from the terminal.
            03. we determine if your answer was correct or not,  and will take action depending on the mode you selected.
